## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

Primary key defines the property that the database will use to organize the table. And foreign key is used to give your property a value from a propertiy from another table.

2. What is an `Alias`?

Aliases in MySQL is used to give a temporary name to a table or a column in a table for the purpose of a particular query.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)


SELECT 
d.*,
p.*
FROM doctors d
JOIN patients p ON d.patientId = p.id
```
