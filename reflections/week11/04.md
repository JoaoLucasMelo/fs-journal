## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I am very grateful to be able to finish this course sucessfully, I've learned a lot, even more than I expected to learn and developed a love for coding that will definately allow me to work with something I love doing. With that said I dont think I will manage my time poorly doing something I really like doing.
