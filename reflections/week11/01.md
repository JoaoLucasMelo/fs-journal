## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Gives us the pre built information to create a class using other class informations attached.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

The class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that inherits those members is called the derived class. When you define a class to inherit from another class, the inherited class implicitly gains all the members of the base class, except for its constructors and finalizers.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Access modifiers in a classes members give different levels of access to derived classes. The child classes have different access to the members of the inherited class depending upon the access modifier.
