# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This week more last week surprised me with brand new content that I never knew about and i guess all the following weeks are gonna be the same. I struggled a lot this week but as good struggle happens I can overcome and learn even more every time, Victory like every week is being able to finish the Checkpoint on time even though this weeks checkpoint was a real challenge to me and I had more issues than usual but I overcame in the end.
