## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

I always try to implement a good UX into my projects. And since we had a partner project the reading about pair programming was a good start.

2. What went well this week?

The partner checkpoint was very good and ended up with a good and fun app that can be used and turned into many themes as desired. Learned a lot more about Vue and even more over the weekend with the individual checkpoint.

3. What would you do differently?

I believe I am getting better with mymdivision of time when creating a project but still have some room for improvement, for example start and focus on logistics before aesthetics.
