## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One-to-One, One-to-Many and Many-to-Many.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

It could be easier to access the linked data in an independent manner for example to search for an especific data inside that object.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

It can get hard to decide what needs to be linked to what in case you want to reference them in the future, in other words, you may not need two objects to be related now but down the road you might need that option for a desired funcionallity in your app.
