## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing, Component Testing, and End-To-End (E2E) Testing. 
Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation.
Component testing frameworks were created to give users the ability to do this in a reliable way while also providing Vue-specific conveniences such as integrations for Vuex, Vue Router, and other Vue plugins.
E2E tests validate all of the layers in your application. 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Component testing. Used to fully assert that the app is working testing it already mounted to the DOM. Has a optimal error reporting in my opinion.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Unit testing. In my opinion should be better to test the code in a group better simulating how it would work on a real life example.
