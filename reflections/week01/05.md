# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I think the week was great, loved the classes and look foward to the next days.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

Learned CSS and bootstrap almost from nothing and already doing some pretty nice stuf, in my opinion of course.

- What are you struggling with?

Mostly, Orders, and Display flex, but always searching online and figuring out.

- What would you count as a victory?

This first checkpoint done and able to all the assignments this week.
