# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This week was very good as well, good learning and good struggle. What surprised me this week was that around the middle of the week I got stuck with the new information and that bothered me a lot caus I couldnt understand the new methods, but friday, as I was very concerned about the checkpoint, when I started my project it went way better than I expected and things worked out very well. Last week I had more trouble on my checkpoint somehow, I guess becouse I had more practice this time when using the same information I needed last week on this weeks project.
