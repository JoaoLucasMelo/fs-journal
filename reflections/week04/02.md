## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending, Resolved or Rejected.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

By attaching a callback to a Promise rather than passing it using a chaining "method".

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

The "then" method is called after the Promise is resolved. And "catch" is called if the promise fails.
