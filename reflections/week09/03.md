## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Is an encoding algorithm that converts any characters, binary data, and even images or sound files into a readable string, which can be saved or transported over the network without data loss.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

 If the 5 base64 images all come in one request, that request will have to complete before anything is shown on the screen. All 5 images go from blank placeholders to almost immediately decoded from base64 and displayed in place.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

Although Base64 is a relatively efficient way of encoding binary data it will, on average still increase the file size for more than 25%. This not only increases your bandwidth bill, but also increases the download time.
