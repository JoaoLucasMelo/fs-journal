## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

The area where a variable (var, let or const) will be valid.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Is how JS moves all the variables to the top of their scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

let almost always, for having a different scope than var and being updatable. const when you dont want the variable to change during the whole project. var has a bigger scope than let and const.
