# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

  This week was surprisingly good, surprisingly because during some challenges mid week I completly felt lost and that I wasnt gonna understand some concepts, but as the week went by I realized that I WAS learning more and more with my own mistakes and challenges. So much that I felt very comfortable doing my checkpoint this week and had fun with it. Of course had some bumps but thats what is good to learn even more.
